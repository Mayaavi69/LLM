# Installing privateGPT on ubuntu 22.04
# It works with a Gui
# Ref: https://docs.privategpt.dev/installation/getting-started/installation
#      https://github.com/PromptEngineer48/Ollama/tree/main/2-ollama-privateGPT-chat-with-docs

# 0.0 Install Anaconda, if not installed

# 0.1 Syntax to remove conda env -- myenv

        conda remove --name langchain --all

# 0.2 Install on ubuntu plocate to use 'locate'
#     command to search files:

sudo apt install plocate

# 1. Create environment and 
#     setup necessary packages:
#      Open Anaocnda prompt as 'Administrator'
#       and run the following commands, step-by-step:
#        privatGPT requiires python=3.11

# 1.0.1 Add a download channel:
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# 1.0.2 Create conda environment:
conda create --name langchain python=3.11
conda activate langchain
conda install spyder jupyter jupyterlab pandas numpy pip-tools ipython


# 1.0.3 Install git, as:
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install git
# OR as:
(See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-all

# 1.0.4 Install curl:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl


# 2.0 Clone privateGPT
#     We will clone it in our home folder:

cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT
cd privateGPT

# 2.0.1. From now onwards we must work in the new conda env
#         Activate conda environment langchain
#          and also cd to folder privateGPT:
#           cd ~/privateGPT

# 2.0.2. Install poetry:
#	 poetry is a more modern way to install python libraries
#	 and its dependencies. It is more effective than conda or pip
# 	 https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer
#        Also see:
#	actcorp.com/blog/Deep-Learning/managing-python-dependencies-with-poetry-vs-conda-pip

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# 2.0.3 Add poetry path to ~/.bashrc file:

export PATH="/home/ashok/.local/bin:$PATH"

# 3.0 Close and reopen terminal:

conda activate langchain
cd privateGPT

# 3.0.1 Check poetry is installed:
poetry --version


# 3.0.2 Install 'make':
#	'make' generally comes installed with ubuntu 22.04
#	IF not, install it as:

sudo apt-get install build-essential

# 4.0 Install ollama:
#     See https://ollama.com/download :

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# 4.0.1 Install the models to be used, the default settings-ollama.yaml
#       is configured to user mistral 7b LLM (~4GB) and nomic-embed-text Embeddings (~275MB).
#       In privateGPT, ollama configuration file is: ~/privateGPT/settings-ollama.yaml

# 4.0.2 Issue following commands to download mistral and nomic-embed-text:
#        Downloaded models are saved to folder /usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models

ollama pull mistral
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# 4.0.2.1 You can also specify the number of parameters.
#	   Pull ollama:13b model, as:

ollama pull llama2:13b

# And run it as:

ollama run llama2:13b

# 4.0.2.2 Just entering the following command will pull a 7b model and then run
#         but not the already existing 13b model:

ollama run llama2


# 4.0.3 You can test ollama, as:

ollama run mistral

# 4.0.4 On terminal, write a question to get an answer.


# 5.0    On reboot ollama starts by itself. The following command is NOT NEEEDED:
#	 It is also very difficult to kill olama process (even by kill -9). After
#	 killing another ollama process starts.

#        ollama serve

# 5.0.1 On restart, issue again the following commands:

	a. conda activate langchain
        b. cd ~/privateGPT


# 6.0. Install software using poetry:

conda activate langchain
cd ~/privateGPT
poetry install --extras "ui llms-ollama embeddings-ollama vector-stores-qdrant"


# 6.0.1 Install tensorflow:

pip install tensorflow

# 6.0.2 You may have to also make following change to ~/privateGPT/settings.yaml file
#       If there is an error, see here:
#       https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt/issues/1334#issuecomment-1847997849
#       https://docs.privategpt.dev/manual/storage/vector-stores#chroma-configuration
#       Go to settings.yaml and change

	vectorstore: database: qdrant
	to
	vectorstore: database: chroma

#     And rebooot/restart privateGPT as follows:

conda activate langchain
cd privateGPT

PGPT_PROFILES=ollama make run

# 6.1 The UI will be available at http://localhost:8001
