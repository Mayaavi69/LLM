Uninstall a WSL installation of Ubuntu like a normal Windows 10 application.
To uninstall Ubuntu, right-click the Ubuntu shortcut in your Start menu and 
click Uninstall.

To reinstall Ubuntu, download it from the Microsoft Store once again.

To (optionally) also uninstall Windows Subsystem for Linux:
Open the Control Panel and go to Programs -> Turn Windows Features On or Off.
Uncheck the Windows Subsystem for Linux option there and click OK. Windows will 
uninstall Windows Subsystem for Linux, bash.exe, and lxrun.exe commands.
